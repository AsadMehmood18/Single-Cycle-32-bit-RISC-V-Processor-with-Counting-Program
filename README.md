# Single-Cycle-32-bit-RISC-V-Processor-with-Counting-Program
This project features a fully functioning single-cycle 32-bit RISC-V processor designed in Logisim. It includes a counting program from 1 to 10, written in the Venus simulator, with machine code loaded into the CPU's ROM. The processor's output is connected to a hexadecimal segment display, showing the count during simulation.
